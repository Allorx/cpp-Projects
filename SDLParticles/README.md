This follows from ![C++ Tutorial for Complete Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/free-learn-c-tutorial-beginners/) tutorial on Udemy which I would highly recommend as a practical introduction to programming including some fundamentals.

A small fun SDL2 project with cpu particles that swirl and change colour - looks like a screensaver; good for understanding basic cpu rendering using SDL2 and multi-platform building bundles using CMake.

![SDL particales swirling](https://github.com/Allorx/cpp-Projects/blob/master/SDLParticles/sdl.gif)

- CMake is included for multiplatform compiling and building of app bundles

- If opening Xcode project (needs independent setup) make sure library and header files are in the correct path and includes are correct i.e. "SDL2/SDL.h", make sure SDL2 is installed with "brew install sdl2"
