A small fun SDL2 project with cpu particles that swirl and change colour - looks like a screensaver; good for understanding basic cpu rendering using SDL2 and multi-platform building bundles using CMake.

![Alt Text](https://github.com/Allorx/cpp-Projects/blob/master/SDLParticles/sdl.gif)

- Make sure SDL2 is installed with "brew install sdl2"
- CMake is included for multiplatform compiling and building of app bundles
- If opening Xcode project make sure library and header files are in the correct path and includes are correct i.e. "SDL2/SDL.h"
