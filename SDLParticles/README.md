A small fun SDL2 project with cpu particles that swirl and change colour - looks like a screensaver; good for understanding basic cpu rendering using SDL2

- Make sure SDL2 is installed with "brew install sdl2"
- Cmake is included to ease compile.
- If opening Xcode project make sure library and header files are in the correct path and includes are correct i.e. "SDL2/SDL.h"
